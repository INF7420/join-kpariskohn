    <p>Hi! I'm an MLIS student at Wayne State University. This past May, I defended my Ph.D. in Chemistry at Michigan
      State University, and I moved with my family to California shortly thereafter. For my dissertation research, I
      explored undergraduate students' perceptions of the relationship between their general chemistry course
      sequence
      and introductory cell and molecular biology course. To this end, I conducted three qualitative studies focusing
      on the concepts of energy and the relationship between structure, properties, and function. For more
      information
      about this work, please visit <a href="research.html">my research page</a>.
      While my dissertation focused on the extensive interview data I collected and analyzed in collaboration with <a
        href="https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/cooper/">Dr. Melanie Cooper</a> and <a href="http://myweb.fiu.edu/sunderwo/">Dr.
        Sonia Underwood</a>, I have also collected complex survey data using Qualtrics, studied students' ability to
      construct organic mechanisms, and conducted synthetic organic chemistry research under the guidance of <a href="https://www.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty-research/faculty-members/john-w-frost/">Dr.
        John Frost.</a></p>



    <h2>Teaching and Mentoring Experience</h2>
    <p> I began teaching chemistry in 2011 as an undergraduate teaching assistant at the University of Pittsburgh. As a
      graduate student at Michigan State University, I expanded my repitoire to include both general and organic
      chemistry laboratory and recitation sections. Further, I have over 400 hours of one-on-one tutoring high school
      students in math and science, including AP Calculus, AP Statistics, AP Chemistry, and AP Environmental Science,
      and providing mentorship in study skills, ACT prep, and general problem-solving approaches.</p>
