    <h2>Academic Librarianship</h2>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing an <abbr title="Masters in Library and Information Science">MLIS</abbr> at Wayne State
      University. As an academic librarian, I look forward to using my experiences conducting research, teaching, and collaborating across disciplinary boundaries to help students and faculty find the information necessary to further their academic pursuits. This includes fostering their development of skills to better understand and acquire information for themselves. </p>
    <h2>Chemistry Education Research</h2>
    <p>For my doctoral dissertation, I explored undergraduate students' perceptions of the relationship between their
      general chemistry course sequence and introductory cell and molecular biology course. To this end, I conducted
      three qualitative studies focusing on the concepts of energy and the relationship between structure, properties,
      and function. For more information about this work, please visit <a href="research.html">my research page</a>.</p>
