  <h2>Academic Librarianship</h2>
  <p>I'm currently pursuing an <abbr title="Masters in Library and Information Science">MLIS</abbr> at Wayne State University. To be continued.</p>
  <h2>Chemistry Education Research</h2>
  <p>For my doctoral dissertation, I explored undergraduate students' perceptions of the relationship between their general chemistry course sequence and introductory cell and molecular biology course. To this end, I conducted three qualitative studies focusing on the concepts of energy and the relationship between structure, properties, and function. For more information about this work, please visit <a href="research.html">my research page</a></p>
